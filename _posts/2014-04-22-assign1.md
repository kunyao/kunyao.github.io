title: Assignment Iâ€”Image and Signal Processing
---
This is the report for the first assignment of CSE 190. With great fun in these three weeks, I implement almost all of the techniques except convolution in frequency domain and compositing. As I work alone on this project, please don't criticize me too much on not leaving enough comments on my code. I will try my best to explain my work in this writeup. At last, thank *Ravi* for this great assignment.

## Basic Operations
There is nothing complex in this section. I will briefly post up my result below. 

### Brighten
Using command:
{% highlight js %}
./image -brightness factor <flower.bmp >out.bmp
{% endhighlight %} 
I get results with factor 0,0.5,1,1.5,2.
![placeholder](../img/bri0.bmp "0") 
![placeholder](../img/bri0.5.bmp "0.5")
![placeholder](../img/bri1.bmp "1")
![placeholder](../img/bri1.5.bmp "1.5")
![placeholder](../img/bri2.bmp "2")
