title: Assignment IIâ€”Mesh Simplification
---
This is the writeup for the second assignment of `CSE 190`. Data structure is everything in this project, so in the beginning, I will briefly summarize my analysis of mesh simplification problem and reason why I choose these structures. After that, I will post up the results from single test model to the large complex ones. At last, I will mention two main bugs which I spent most of time dealing with.
