title: Assignment IIâ€”Mesh Simplification
---
This is the writeup for the second assignment of `CSE 190`. Data structure is everything in this project, so in the beginning, I will briefly summarize my analysis of mesh simplification problem and reason why I choose these structures. After that, I will post up the results from single test models to the large complex ones. At last, I will mention two main bugs which I spent most of the time dealing with.

## Analysis
We need to do following steps for an edge collapse process:

    1. Find two points `V0`, `V1` in the vertices set. Remove these two vertives and insert a new vertex.
    2. Find all the faces adjacent to these two vertices.
    3. Change all the adjacent  
    4. Remove the common faces.
