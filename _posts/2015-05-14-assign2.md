title: Assignment IIâ€”Mesh Simplification
---
This is the writeup for the second assignment of `CSE 190`. Data structure is everything in this project, so in the beginning, I will briefly summarize my analysis of mesh simplification problem and explain the reason why I choose these structures. After that, I will post up the results from single test models to the large complex ones. At last, I will mention two main bugs which I spent most of the time dealing with.

## Analysis

### General 

Using `indexed face set` with `vertex to face adjacency table` is quite straight forward: `openGL` draw function only concerns about *faces* and *vertices*. And we can not gain benefits if we introduce *edges* in `edge collapse` process. 

However we need to do write down every step in details before we choose the specific structure:

In an `edge collapse` procedure, we need to:

1. Find two points **V0**, **V1** in the vertices set. Remove these two vertives and insert a new vertex **V**;
2. Find all the faces adjacent to **V0**, **V1**;
3. Change all **V0**, **V1** in the adjacent faces to **V**;
4. Remove the common faces of **V0**, **V1**;
5. Insert **V** in adjacency table and update the adjacency table for the vertices adjacent to **V0**, **V1**. And remove **V0**, **V1**.

Beside that, for illustration, we have to update vertices normals and face colors properly.

In sum, we need the date structures to do following operations in constant time:

| Structure        | Contents              | Operations                   |
| :---:            | :--:                  | :---:                        |
| Vertices         | (x,y,z) coordinate(3) | Look up; Insert; Remove        |
| Faces            | vertices index(3)   | Look up; Update; Remove        |
| V2F Adjacency    | <abbr title="All faces adjacent to the vertex">**faces index(N)**</abbr>       | Look up; Update; Insert; Remove |
| Vertices Normals | normal value(1)       | Look up; Update; Insert; Remove |
| Face Colors      | color value(3)        | Look up; Remove               |

### Tricks:

In fact, we don't need to traverse for all the structure relate to vertices.
(We have to do that in faces, as we draw for each face)
Therefore, for those 'vertices' structures, we can drop remove operation. For example, for Vertices structure, we can just make **V** take the place of **V0**. The same trick can be also used for V2F Adjacency and Vertices Normals.
