title: Assignment IIâ€”Mesh Simplification
---
This is the writeup for the second assignment of `CSE 190`. Data structure is everything in this project, so in the beginning, I will briefly summarize my analysis of mesh simplification problem and explain the reason why I choose these structures. After that, I will post up the results from single test models to the large complex ones. At last, I will mention two main bugs which I spent most of the time dealing with.

## Analysis
### General 

Using `indexed face set` with `vertex to face adjacency table` is quite straight forward: `openGL` draw function only concerns about *faces* and *vertices*. And we can not gain benefits if we introduce *edges* in `edge collapse` process. 

However we need to do write down every step in details before we choose the specific structure:

In an `edge collapse` procedure, we need to:

1. Find two points `V0`, `V1` in the vertices set. Remove these two vertives and insert a new vertex `V`.
2. Find all the faces adjacent to `V0`, `V1`.
3. Change all `V0`, `V1` in the adjacent faces to `V`
4. Remove the common faces of `V0`, `V1`. 
5. Insert `V` in adjacency table and update the adjacency table for the vertices adjacent to `V0`, `V1`. And remove `V0`, `V1`.

Beside that, for illustration, we have to update vertices normals and face colors properly.

Therefore we need the date structures to do these steps in constant time:

| Structure     | Things to do                 |
| :---:         | :---:                        |
| Vertices      | Look up;Insert;Remove        |
| Faces         | Look up;Update;Remove        |
| V2F Adjacency | Look up;Update;Insert;Remove |
