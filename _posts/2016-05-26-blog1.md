## Short Description

This writeup is for `CSE 167` final project in which we will implement some groundbreaking real-time rendering techniques. One of them is screen space ray tracing. We will build our project based on [Morgan McGuire etc](http://jcgt.org/published/0003/04/04/). Also, using modeled water as our main object, vivid wave effect will be created. In the end, We hope we can achieve a fancy sea scene with natural environment lights and soft shadows in real time.

## Plan

With a toy tray tracer in hand already, it may take less than a week to get screen space ray tracer work. At the same time, my partner will take care of the water modeling part. After that, we will integrate everything and maybe add other components.
